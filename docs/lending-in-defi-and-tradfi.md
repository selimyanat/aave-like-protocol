Unlike TradeFi, which relies on centralized intermediaries and order books that match individual buy and sell orders. 
DeFi lending protocols are built on blockchain technology and works without order books. Instead they leverage Automated 
Market Maker (AMM) models which use algorithms and liquidity pools to facilitate transactions. In these systems, 
individuals and organizations can deposit assets to earn interest or borrow assets against collateral. Among the most
popular lending protocols: AAVE, Compound, Maker.
