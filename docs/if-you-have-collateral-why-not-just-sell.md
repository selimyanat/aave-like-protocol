# Why Borrow If You Have To Provide Collateral ?

The principal reason for a borrower to borrow against an asset is that it allows to access liquidity without
selling their assets, which is partularly useful for the following reasons - **non exhaustive list**

*  Avoiding taxes: Selling assets such as `BTC` or `ETH` , depending on your fiscal country, might trigger capital gains taxes. Borrowing avoid that, by allowing access capital while holding assets.

* Maintaining market exposure: If you hold an asset such as `BTC` that
you believe will eventually reach one million dollars, you may prefer to keep holding it while borrowing stable coins such as `USDC` to use for trading or real world expenses.

* Increase retunrs: Let's say you borrow `5000 USDC` and put `10 ETH` as collateral. You then use the borrowed money to buy more `ETH`. Later, the price of `ETH` increases, allowing you to realize a profit from your loan. You sell the gained `ETH` to repay the loan and the interest, keeping the remaining profit. You end up with your original `10 ETH` plus the additional gains. - leveraged speculation put it simply
