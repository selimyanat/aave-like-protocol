# Liquidation

```
Imagine Alice has 5 ETH (worth $10,000 at $2,000 per ETH). She wants to borrow $6,000 in USDC.  She deposits her 5 ETH into a DeFi lending protocol as collateral.  The ETH is locked, and Alice receives her 6,000 USDC.  If Alice repays the loan plus interest, she gets her 5 ETH back.  If she doesn't, or if the value of ETH drops significantly, the protocol can automatically sell some of the ETH to cover the loan

This collateralisation system is designed to limit the credit risk for the lender, but it does not eliminate it entirely. The lender is still exposed to the risk of a sharp devaluation of the collateral (asset B in the diagram), for example in the event of a contagion between the crypto-assets used as collateral (see article by Tovanich, Kassoul, Weidenholzer and Prat, 2023), or a cyberattack on the platform. On this issue, see also the rapport by the ACPR.

Why Your Crypto Collateral is at Risk
In DeFi, taking out a loan means providing crypto collateral – but the value of cryptocurrency is volatile. The value of the Ethereum or NFTs you used as collateral last week might have completely changed this week and if the collateral itself falls in value, it’s no longer useful to the DeFi lender as a guarantee. To be clear, this problem exists in the traditional finance space aswell – any asset can change in value. But the issue is far more common, and far more pronounced, in DeFi, because the value of crypto is so inconsistent.

So for borrowers, DeFi might represent huge freedom, less red tape and new opportunities for borrowing – but it also presents a higher level of risk when it comes to their crypto collateral. And it’s you, the borrower, who bears that risk.

Collateralization and Liquidation: To ensure the system's security, loans are over-collateralized. If the collateral value falls below a certain threshold, the protocol can automatically liquidate the assets to cover the debt, minimizing the risk for lenders.

```
- Example of Liquidation: Consider a borrower who has deposited 10 ETH as collateral to borrow 5,000 DAI, with an LTV of 75%. If the value of ETH drops significantly, causing the collateral to be worth less than 75% of the borrowed DAI, the protocol may initiate liquidation to protect the lenders' interests.

The use of debt tokens within such platforms has introduced a new level of efficiency and accessibility to financial services, particularly in terms of lending and borrowing.

1. Programmability: Debt tokens are highly programmable, meaning they can be integrated into complex financial instruments and smart contracts. This allows for the creation of automated loan repayment schedules, interest rate adjustments, and collateral management.

Example: A borrower could receive a debt token that automatically adjusts its interest rate based on the prevailing market conditions, ensuring they always get a fair rate.

4. Interoperability: These tokens can be used across different DeFi platforms and protocols, thanks to the standardized formats like ERC-20. This interoperability facilitates a more connected and efficient DeFi ecosystem.

Example: A debt token issued on Aave could be used as collateral on another DeFi platform, increasing the utility of the token.
