# Liquidation

```
Imagine Alice has 5 ETH (worth $10,000 at $2,000 per ETH). She wants to borrow $6,000 in USDC.  She deposits her 5 ETH into a DeFi lending protocol as collateral.  The ETH is locked, and Alice receives her 6,000 USDC.  If Alice repays the loan plus interest, she gets her 5 ETH back.  If she doesn't, or if the value of ETH drops significantly, the protocol can automatically sell some of the ETH to cover the loan
