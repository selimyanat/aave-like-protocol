# Liquidity pool


DeFI relies on blockchain where anonymity is a
cornerstone where no history of repayment is attached to wallet that is the main idenfier for individual.  



 Blockchain is conducted with anonymized wallets (for now), and there is no history of repayment or liquidity to attach to these transactions. For the most part, blockchain protocols resolve this by requiring collateral of some sort, usually valued significantly more than the amount of the loan. Collateralization will be discussed further, but both methods of reducing risk have problems.


# Interests

operates differently than traditional finance (TradFi). From
a pure structural angle, omitting the  
that relies on order book that matches individual buy and sell orders. These protocols leverage liquidity
pool where depositors can deposit assets to earn interests, while borrowers can borrow asset against a
collateral.


Interest rates within these protocols are typically determined algorithmically based on the supply and demand dynamics of the pooled assets. When the demand for borrowing increases relative to the available supply, interest rates rise to incentivize more deposits; conversely, when supply exceeds demand, interest rates decrease to encourage borrowing


Traditional Finance (TradFi) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) represent two distinct paradigms in the financial landscape, each with unique structures, operations, and approaches to borrowing.

![Lending Protocol Use Case Diagram](lending-protocols-use-case.png)




Lending protocols are essentially digital platforms built on blockchains that allow people to lend and borrow crypto without needing a bank or intermediary - trust-less system (no credit checks nor personal guarantees) . Among the most popular lending protocols: 
** Aave
** MakerDAO
** Compound


Bascially a lender, deposits some crypto on the lending protocol in exchange of interests. A borrower, put in collateral an asset in exchange of the
traded asset, the whole point for a borrower is to keep their collateral without requring them to sell them. 

Lending/borrowing protocols allow users to offer crypto loans by staking their assets in them without the need for a bank account. Users are given rewards, usually in the form of the protocol's native token.
