# Why Is A Collateral Needed ?

To understand the rationale behind the collateral mechanism in DeFi, let's draw a parallel 
with its counterpart in `TradFi`: the credit score.

## The Credit Score in TradFi

In traditional finance, a credit score is a numerical value that represents a borrower's 
creditworthiness and indicates the likelihood of repaying a loan on time. It is determined 
by the borrower's financial history, which includes information like:

* Total debts
* Repayment history
* Age
* Health
* Profession
* Other risk indicators

## The DeFi Approach

In contrast, preserving anonymity and personal identities are fundamental to blockchain. 
Therefore, `DeFi` lending protocols do not rely on these traditional mechanisms to determine 
creditworthiness. Instead, they address the challenge by requiring collateralâ€”an amount of an 
asset that is worth significantly more than the loan itself.

## Why Over-Collateralization ?

This over-collateralization ensure that in the event of load default or misbehaviour the 
collateral can be seized to cover losses. It is pretty similar to staking in proof-of-stake 
(PoS) blockchain consensus model where network participants lock up asset to secure the network 
and are penalized for misconduct.
