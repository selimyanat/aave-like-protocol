# Why is a collateral needed ?

To understand the rational behind the collateral mechanism in DeFI, let's draw a parallel with its counterpart in TradFi:
The credit score. This nuumerical value represnets a borrower's creditworthiness and indicates the likelihood of repaying
a loan on time. It is determined by the borrower's financial history which include information like total debts, repayment history, age, health, professon and other risk indicators. In contrast, as preserving anonymity and personal identities are fundamental to blockchain, DeFi lending protocols do not rely on these mechanisms to dertermine creditworthiness. 
Instead, they address the challenge by requiring a collateral that is an amount of an asset that is worth significantly more than the loan itself. This over-collateralization ensure that in the event of load default or misbehaviour the collateral can be seized to cover losses. It is pretty similar to staking in proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain consensus
model where network participants lock up asset to secure the network and are penalized for misconduct.
