The DeFi space offers alternatives to every aspect of financial services, including insurance, trading, loans, and savings. 
This repository explores the concept of loan through the implementation of a lending protocol similar to AAVE. The intent 
is not to compete with established protocols but to demonstrate the main mechanisms involved in such a protocol. 

Starting a journey in the DeFi space can be challenging, so this demo application serves as an introductory step towards 
understanding DeFi and lending protocols. Before diving into the code, the following documentation will shed some lights 
on key concepts and provide you with a solid fundamentals. So without further ado, let's begin the journey.
